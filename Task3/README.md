# Task submision for job Interview - Jan

Coding task part of the job interview

**!!! NOT ACTUALLY WORKING OR TESTED CODE !!!** <br>
The task explicitly stated that the code does not have to be able to run as the provided api credentials are fake 

But if it was actually meant to run it would be like this:
## Installation

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the needed dependencies.

```bash
composer install
```

Fill in your BigCommerce credentials in `src/Config/conf.php`
## Usage

Point webserver root towards the `public` folder 

or for local testing run
```bash
composer run local-server
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
